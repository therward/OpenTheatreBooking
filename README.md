# OpenTheatreBooking
This is a complete seat booking system that would work best in theatres or cinemas. The program allows a custom seat layout and the ability to add many performances to one page. Please note that this program is in very early stages of development and is missing many key features. If you are planning to use this project please make sure you have knowledge of HTML, JavaScript and PHP.

# Features: 
+ Adjustable seat layout to ajust to any theatre layout (From 20 seats to 1000+!) 
+ Ability to add different performances to book 
+ Different prices based on the performance 
+ A QR ticket generate upon completion of a ticket being booked
+ A orders record which will generate a unique order number and save it for the theatre to check people in upon entry 
+ Stalls and Grand Circle seating 

# Coming Soon 
This software is in its very very early stages and many features will be coming soon like:
+ Account system - allows users to view shows they have booked 
+ Payment gateway intergration 
+ Theatre management system - this will allow you to modify the prices of seats for the performance (for example, closer seats more expensive than the back row). It will also allow the theatre to add performances.
+ Performance times - at the moment users can only select from a long list of performances, instead i wish to move this to just performances and then the ability to select the time after that. 

Please submit a request for any other features that you may think will benefit the program!
